### About

The intent is to stream a camera feed watching the monocle display.

In this case a phone looking at the monocle using a mount like below.

The issue here is I'm not able to select the macro camera which would be better suited using web `enumerateDevices()`

Anyway I have working example on the [vonage](github.com/jdc-cunningham/bl-monocle-video-stream/tree/vonage) branch which is a paid service.

They do all the heavy lifting of video for you but you pay for it.

I have not put the time in to setup WebRTC myself from scratch.
